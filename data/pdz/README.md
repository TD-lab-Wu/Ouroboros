# README
This folder contains PDZ-peptide related data.

* specificity.csv contains information about the different specificity classes
* contact_mtx.csv is the used contact matrix
* matched_peptides_stringent.fasta and matched_domains_stringent.fasta contain the interacting set; a line in one file corresponds to an interacting protein with the sequence at the same line in the other file
* random_domains_stringent_new_X and random_peptides_stringent_new_X contain different non-interacting sets, followed by the random seed used

The mixed folder contains alignments ready for use by the algorithm, with different proportions of interacting sequences.

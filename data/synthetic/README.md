# README

This directory contains synthetic data examples.

* contact_mtx.csv contains the contact matrix.
* alnint_X.fasta: sets of 10000 paired synthetic interacting proteins
* clean_nonint_X.fasta: filtered sets of 10000 paired synthetic non-interacting proteins
* subset_X_Yint.fasta: mixtures of interacting and non-interacting proteins with a certain percentage of interacting proteins. Interacting proteins are the first 1100 ones.
